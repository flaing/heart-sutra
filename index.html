<h3><b>Heart of Wisdom Sutra
  </b> </h3>
<p>Thus I have heard: at one time, 
  the Blessed One was dwelling in Rajagriha on Massed Vultures Mountain together 
  in one method with a great assembly of monks and a great assembly of Bodhisattvas. 
  At that time, the Blessed One was absorbed in the concentration of the countless 
  aspects of phenomena called Profound Illumination. <br>
  At that time also Superior Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva, the great being, 
  was looking perfectly at the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom, 
  perfectly looking at the emptiness of inherent existence of the five aggregates 
  also. <br>
  Then, through the power of Buddha, the Venerable Shariputra said to the Superior 
  Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva, the great being, &quot;How should a son the 
  lineage train who wishes to engage in the practice of the profound perfection 
  of wisdom?&quot; <br>
  Thus he spoke, and the Superior Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva, the great 
  being, replied to the Venerable Shariputra as follows: <br>
  &quot;Shariputra, whatever son or daughter of the lineage wishes to engage in 
  the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom should look perfectly like 
  this: subsequently looking perfectly and correctly at the emptiness of inherent 
  existence of the five aggregates also&quot;. <br>
  &quot;Form is empty; emptiness is form. Emptiness is not other than form; form 
  also is not other than emptiness. Likewise, feeling, discrimination, compositional 
  factors and consciousness are empty&quot; <br>
  &quot;Shariputra, like this all phenomena are merely empty, having no characteristics. 
  They are not produced and do not cease. They have no defilement and no separation 
  from defilement. They have no decrease and no increase&quot;. <br>
  &quot;Therefore, Shariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no discrimination, 
  no compositional factors, no consciousness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, 
  no tongue, no body, no mind; no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no tactile 
  object, no phenomenon. There is no eye element and so forth up to no mind element 
  and also up to no element of mental consciousness. There is no ignorance and 
  no exhaustion of ignorance, and so forth up to no aging and death and no exhaustion 
  of aging and death. Likewise, there is no suffering, origin, cessation or path; 
  no exalted wisdom, no attainment and no non-attainment&quot;. <br>
  &quot;Therefore Shariputra, because there is no attainment, Bodhisattvas rely 
  on and abide in the perfection of wisdom; their minds have no obstructions and 
  no fear. Passing utterly beyond perversity, they attain the final state beyond 
  sorrow. Also, all the Buddhas who perfectly reside in the three times, relying 
  upon the perfection of wisdom, become manifest and complete Buddhas in the state 
  of unsurpassed, perfect and complete enlightenment&quot;. <br>
  &quot;Therefore, the mantra of the perfection of wisdom, the mantra of great 
  knowledge, the unsurpassed mantra, the equal-to-the-unequalled mantra, the mantra 
  that thoroughly pacifies all suffering, since it is not false, should be known 
  as the truth. The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed: <br>
  TAYATA GATE GATE PARAGATE PARASAMGATE BODHI SOHA <br>
  (Gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond, awakened, so be it!) <br>
  &quot;Shariputra, a Bodhisattva, a great being, should train in the profound 
  perfection of wisdom like this&quot;. <br>
  Then the Blessed One arose from that concentration and said to the Superior 
  Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva, the great being, that he had spoken well. 
  &quot;Good, good, O son of the lineage. It is like that. Since it is like that, 
  just as you have revealed, the profound perfection of wisdom should be practiced 
  in that way, and the Tathagatas will also rejoice&quot;. <br>
  When the Blessed One has said this, the Venerable Shariputra, the Superior Avalokiteshvara, 
  the Bodhisattva, the great being, and that entire assembly of disciples as well 
  as the worldly beings - gods, humans, demi-gods and spirits - were delighted 
  and highly praised what has been spoken by the Blessed One.</b> <br><br>
(The noble &quot;Heart 
  of the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra&quot; is complete).
